PigeonEngine

PigeonEngine is a lightweight, real-time graphics engine designed for Linux, primarily Ubuntu. It aims to provide an efficient and modular solution for rendering 2D/3D graphics, featuring a custom-built editor that simplifies object creation by allowing users to specify file paths for textures and models. The project is currently under development, with ongoing improvements such as a real-time text editor for adjusting lighting and materials.

PigeonEngine is envisioned as a hybrid between Blender and Unity, offering a streamlined workflow while maintaining powerful rendering capabilities.
Features

    Modern OpenGL Rendering â€“ Efficient rendering pipeline optimized for real-time applications.
    Custom Engine Editor â€“ Create, manage, and manipulate objects in a visual interface.
    Real-Time Asset Loading â€“ Import 2D textures and 3D models by simply providing a file path.
    Lighting and Material Editing â€“ (In Development) A built-in text editor to allow real-time modification of lighting and material properties.
    Cross-Platform Codebase â€“ Primarily supports Ubuntu, but portability is considered for future expansions.
    Mathematics & Transformations â€“ Uses GLM for efficient vector and matrix operations.

Dependencies

Before building PigeonEngine, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

    Assimp â€“ Model file loading and parsing.
    GLM â€“ Mathematics library for vector/matrix transformations.
    GLFW â€“ Windowing and input management.
    GLAD â€“ OpenGL function loader.
    stb_image â€“ Image loading for textures.
    CMake (if building manually).
    C++17 or newer compiler.

Installation
1. Install Dependencies (Ubuntu)

sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake g++ libassimp-dev libglfw3-dev

Other dependencies (GLM, GLAD, stb_image) can be included directly within the project if not available via package manager.
2. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/PigeonEngine.git
cd PigeonEngine

3. Build the Engine

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

4. Run PigeonEngine

./bin/PigeonEngine

This will launch the engine editor where you can create and manipulate objects in a 3D environment.
Usage
Loading Models and Textures

To create objects, simply provide the file path to an image or 3D model in the editor. Supported formats include:

    Models: .obj, .fbx, .dae, .gltf, and more via Assimp.
    Textures: .png, .jpg, .bmp, etc., handled by stb_image.

Transformations & Object Manipulation

    Move, rotate, and scale objects within the editor.
    Modify lighting and materials (real-time editing feature in progress).

Development Roadmap
Short-Term Goals

âœ… Custom-built editor with basic scene management.
âœ… Object creation from file paths (models/textures).
ðŸ”² Real-time material and lighting editor.
ðŸ”² Improved UI/UX for object manipulation.
ðŸ”² Scene-saving and serialization.
Long-Term Vision

    Advanced Material System â€“ Node-based material editing.
    Physics Integration â€“ Basic collision detection and physics support.
    Animation System â€“ Skeletal animation and keyframe-based interpolation.
    Expanded Platform Support â€“ Testing and compatibility for other Linux distributions.
