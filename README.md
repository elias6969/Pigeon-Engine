# Pigeon Engine
PigeonEngine is a **lightweight** and **modular** graphics engine built for **Linux**, primarily **Ubuntu**. It provides a **custom editor** that allows users to create and manipulate objects easily by specifying file paths for **textures** and **3D models**. The engine is currently in development, with ongoing improvements, including a **real-time text editor** for adjusting lighting and materials.

PigeonEngine is designed to combine elements of **Blender** and **Unity**, but with a streamlined workflow and performance-focused design.
## Roadmap
✅ Basic scene editor with object loading.
✅ Support for Assimp models and stb_image textures.
⬜Real-time material & lighting editor (In Progress).
⬜Improved UI for object manipulation.
⬜Scene-saving and serialization.
## Libraries
- [**Assimp**](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) – 3D model loading.
- [**GLM**](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) – Mathematics library.
- [**GLFW**](https://www.glfw.org/) – Window management and input handling.
- [**GLAD**](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) – OpenGL function loader.
- [**stb_image**](https://github.com/nothings/stb) – Image loading.
- **CMake** – For building the project.
- **C++17** or newer compiler.
## Features

- **Custom Engine Editor** – Create and modify objects in an interactive UI.
- **Real-Time Asset Loading** – Import **textures** and **3D models** via file paths.
- **Modern OpenGL Rendering** – Efficient and optimized rendering pipeline.
- **Lighting & Material Editing** *(In Progress)* – Real-time adjustments inside the engine.
